Application is bsed on SpringBoot, using H2 as an in-memory database and Spring Data JPA as the ORM interface.

There are two exposed endpoints:

  /accounts
  /accounts/{id}/transactions
  
/accounts : Retrieves all account details currently present in the database.
/accounts/{id}/transactions: Retrieves all transactions specific to the pasrticular account mentioned through 'id'

Two accounts are hard-coded during application startup, with IDs 123 and 124 respectively.
